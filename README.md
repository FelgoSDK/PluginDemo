Why use Felgo Plugins for your Apps and Games?

There is no need to re-invent the wheel when integrating third party services and platform-specific functionality to your Qt 5 apps & games. Felgo plugins save you weeks in comparison with in-house development, both during implementation and later on for maintaining and updating third-party libraries.

Felgo Plugins use native, platform-specific functionality, meaning that your app seamlessly integrates with existing platform experiences. They incorporate platform-specific human interface guidelines and follow best-practices down to the detail.
